# Timestable Practice

A project I created using HTML and CSS back in December 2020 to practice multipltication tables. 

The game will randomly generate operants between 2-9, keeping score of the user's correct answers to the right of the textbox and will only change once the user has answered correctly. 

If time permits, I would like to add responsive design to this project so that it would look better on most display mediums.
