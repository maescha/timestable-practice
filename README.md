# Timestable Practice

A project I created using HTML and CSS back in December 2020 to practice multipltication tables. 

The game will randomly generate operants between 2-9, keeping score of the user's correct answers to the right of the textbox and will only change once the user has answered correctly. 

This project was not designed responsively and thus, best viewed using a display resolution of 1920x1080.
